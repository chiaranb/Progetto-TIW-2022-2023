## Project of Information Technologies for the Web course at Politecnico di Milano
The project aims to deploy a web application in two distinct versions: pure HTML and RIA (Rich Internet Application). 

In this context, the application enables users, such as the manager of environmental services in a region, to manage a collection of satellite images and a classification taxonomy. This taxonomy is instrumental in labeling images, thus facilitating category-based searches.

## Software used
- Eclipse
- MySQL
